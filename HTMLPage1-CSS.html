        <p class="paragraph1">
            The prominent lord George of Swiffer-Brie (esq.) was an imposing figure of 18:th century Swaffham. So much so that he initiated the first cookie factory after discovering the famous Swiffer-Brie cookie.

            <h4>Lord George travels to France and discovers the Swiffer-Brie cookie</h4>
            <p class="paragraphtext">
                Lord George had a deep affection of exotic tastes, and had for a number of years eaten a Sunday breakfast consisting of Swiffers. -&quot;Tis good for the digestion&quot;, the good lord was recorded saying.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraphtext">
                While on a trip to France, lord George discovered the combined taste of Swiffer and Brie when the honorable messieurs Le Clerc and La Vache, both famous cheese manufacturers, accidentally dropped a piece of Brie in the Swiffer. Lord George was extatic! He bought a cart of the finest Brie and brought back to Swaffham.

            <h4 id="return">Lord George returns home to Swaffham and begins work on the cookie factory</h4>
            <p class="paragraphtext">
                Mrs lord George had always loathed her husbands exotic tastes and when the good lord returned home from France, mrs lord George came up with the idea of making cookies, to hide the taste of Brie and Swiffer. The good lord, who always could spot a good idea, immediately started working on the factory in Swaffham.

            <p class="paragraphtext">
                And so, on a cold day in 1703, the Swiffer-Brie cookie was born. And the success story continues to this day.
